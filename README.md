Welcome to my YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project! This application aims to simplify the process of accessing and analyzing data from various YouTube channels. It's built using SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

**Tools and Libraries Used**
1. **Python:** Primary language for development, from data retrieval to visualization.
2. **Google API Client:** Interacts with YouTube's Data API v3 for retrieving channel and video details.
3. **MongoDB:** Scalable document database for storing structured/unstructured data.
4. **PostgreSQL:** Advanced open-source database for efficient querying and analysis.
5. **Streamlit:** Creates an intuitive interface for easy interaction.

**Required Libraries**

Ensure you have these installed:
1. googleapiclient.discovery
2. streamlit
3. psycopg2
4. pymongo
5. pandas
   
**Features**
1. Retrieve channel and video data from YouTube.
2. Store data in MongoDB for a flexible data lake.
3. Migrate data to PostgreSQL for efficient querying.
4. Search and retrieve data using various options.

**Workflow and Execution**

**1. Data Retrieval**
Use the Google API Client to interact with YouTube's Data API v3 to retrieve channel and video details.
Implement Python scripts to extract data and store it in MongoDB.

**2. Data Warehousing**
Utilize MongoDB as a storage solution for flexible data storage.
Design a schema to structure and organize the data within MongoDB collections.

**3. Data Migration**
Develop scripts to migrate data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL for efficient querying and analysis.
Map MongoDB collections to PostgreSQL tables.

**4. User Interface**
Leverage Streamlit to create an intuitive interface for users to interact with the data.
Implement search and retrieval functionalities based on user-defined criteria.
